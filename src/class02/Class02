<button class="abc", id="Butn"> my button </button>
class - attribute. What ever  we have inside the tag is called attribute
value of class - is abc
button - is a tag
between tags- is a text.
what is the value of the attribute class --> answer: "abc"

---------------------------------------------------------
Locators:
-id
-name
-tagname
-xpath
-linktext
-partialLinkText
-CSS Selector
-ClassName

the purpose of having multiple locators is because some tags might not have an id (u can use another locator)
two webElements have a common locator (e.g. <input id="box"/>, name="textbox"/>
                                            <input id="box", class="btn")
