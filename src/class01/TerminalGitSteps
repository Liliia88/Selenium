 Tracking our first project using Git:
 
 -Open eclipse and create a new project.
 
 step 1: decide where to create the repository (CHOOSE THE RIGHT LOCATION)
 - never make subrepository. 
 - make sure that your repo is inside you project folder.
 working directory of the project is the location where all the files and folders 
 regarding that project are placed.
 
 step2: navigate our terminal to that location
 
 step 3: create the repository -> git init
 
 step 4: check the status of the repository -> git status
 
 step 5: track all the files (ADD ALL FILES TO STAGING AREA) -> git add .
 to add file/folder to staging area - git add src
